"DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER"
A differential amplifier is a fundamental building block in analog cicuit design, widely used in applications such as signal 
amplification, noise reduction and data acquisition systems.It amplifies the difference between two  input signal while rejecting 
common-mode noise,making it ideal for high-precision circuits including operational amplifiers and analog front end systems.

To set the operating point go to Configure Analysis and select Dc operating Point




Effect of VICM on Vout and VP




As the common-mode input voltage ( VICM ) increases, the source voltage ( VP ) also increases,
causing a shift in the operating point. This leads to a higher drain current, resulting
in a greater voltage drop across ( RD ), which reduces ( Vo

# 9. Inference
* M1 and M2 are identical MOSFETs and they are in saturation region.
* When Rss was replaced by current source Iss of 1.2mA, there is a bit difference in the operating point.
* Noise cancelation which is CMRR is the difference of input signals by cancelling the common mode signals.
* From Transient analysis we get the Vout peak to peak voltage to calculate the gain.
* We get high gain when we set AC phase as 180.
