#dc analysis
1:1 ratio:

The drain current with channel length modulation is expressed as:
ID = (1/2)Î¼nCox(W/L)(VGS - Vth)^2
ITotal = P/VDD
ITotal = Iref + Ix
Since the ratio is 1:1 Iref = Ix
Iref = ITotal/2
ITotal = 1 mW/1.8 V
ITotal = 0.555 mA
Iref = 0.555 m/2
Iref = 0.2778 mA.

#Transient analysis:

Change the input voltage to sine and change the amplitude to 50 mV , frequency to 1 kHz and offset voltage to 0.6275 V.
