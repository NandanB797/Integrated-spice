"DIFFERENTIAL AMPLIFIER"
A differential amplifier is a fundamental building block in analog cicuit design, widely used in applications such as signal 
amplification, noise reduction and data acquisition systems.It amplifies the difference between two  input signal while rejecting 
common-mode noise,making it ideal for high-precision circuits including operational amplifiers and analog front end systems.


Q: VDD=1.8V,P<=2.2mW,VICM=0.95V,VOCM=1.1V,Vp=0.4V

CIRCUIT 1: 


STEP 1: Dc analysis

from above
Iss=1.3mA
Id=0.61mA
Rd=1.16kohm
Rss=333ohm
Vgs = vg-vp = 0.95-0.4=>0.55v
Vov=vgs-vth = 0.55-0.366 => 0.184

To set the operating point go to Configure Analysis and select Dc operating Point




Effect of VICM on Vout and VP
As the common-mode input voltage ( VICM ) increases, the source voltage ( VP ) also increases,
causing a shift in the operating point. This leads to a higher drain current, resulting
in a greater voltage drop across ( RD ), which reduces ( Vo
